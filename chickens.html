          The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
          junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey
          and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"
            >Southeastern Asia </a
          >. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger
          male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
          capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature
          female is called a pullet.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
        were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
        BC).<sup>[2][3]</sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
        food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,<sup>[4]</sup> up
        from more than 19 billion in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the
        world than any other bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to
        chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas,
        Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
        Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known
        in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
        every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar,
        Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[8][9][10]</sup>

      <h3>Courtship</h3>
      <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near
        a hen (a 'circle dance'), often lowering the wing which is closest to
        the hen.<sup>[39]</sup> The dance triggers a response in the hen<sup
          >[39]</sup
        >
        and when she responds to his 'call', the rooster may mount the hen and
        proceed with the mating.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
        <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
        <li>Male waltzing</li>
        <li>
          Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away
          (if unwilling to copulate)
        </li>
        <li>Male mounting</li>
        <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
        <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[40]</li>
      </ol>
